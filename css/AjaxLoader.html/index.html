					<p>Intermediate results are out and many young students are now in the phase where they are going to decide their future and career path.&#8221;Which field to choose?&#8221; may be the hot topic among the young lot. At this point, I am sure with all the professionals like us, we are frequently being asked about our field and its scope.</p>
<p>Pakistan, no doubt is continuously and rapidly growing in the telecom industry, whether it be broadband or cellular. Matured wide-spread cellular infrastructure of five major cellular operators is constantly extending, meanwhile after successful 2 and 2.5G, 3G has finally made its entry into the country. ISPs are racing with each other, throwing their cards one after another with WiMAX, GPON or EVDO now, and more and more companies are now investing in this industry. Just like the bandwidth, the telecom industry itself seems to have lost caps.</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.syracuse.com/college_impact/2008/04/080402_college.jpg" alt="null" /></p>
<p>So if you are, or your young fellows are deciding to join this field, make sure they are NOT joining due to the following reasons:</p>
<p>    * <strong>Because I believe the industry has loads of opportunities in Pakistan or abroad</strong><br />
    * Not exactly. Despite the growth, the industry is indeed on the verge of saturation with too many experienced and skilled resources already in the front line to fill in the job positions.  </p>
<p>    * <strong>Because every next person seem to do it</strong><br />
    * Well yes, but don&#8217;t forget that in every field, after a certain period there is saturation of human resources and yes, we may have more telecom graduates then we need. So don&#8217;t follow the herd blindly unless you are 100% sure what you are doing.</p>
<p>    * <strong>Because it seems easier then mechanical or civil</strong><br />
    * Well, not at all. Infact, on the contrary, telecom engineering can be as complex as Noetic science. Even at the bachelor&#8217;s level, the complex configurations, protocols and techniques can drive you crazy. So if you wish to pursue your career in it, make sure you first go through the course outline in depth, which is easily available at any university offering the program and then finalize your decision.</p>
<p>    * <strong>Admissions are easier, since too many private universities are offering it</strong><br />
    * Well if you want to keep the option as backup if you don&#8217;t make it to your desired field and university, then it is acceptable. Yet don&#8217;t forget that with increased quantity, the decrement in quality is natural and most of the private institutions are not doing justice with the field. Make sure if you are going for it, then the program is accredited with HEC and PEC.  </p>
<p>    * <strong>Because my parents/folks want me to go for it</strong><br />
    * Now wait here. I will leave the debate of should parents impose their will on children for choosing profession till next. But unless you are confident that you can easily deal with the mathematics and concepts involved, it&#8217;s better to go with what interests you more.</p>
<p>No doubt the field of telecommunication is indeed very interesting and fascinating, yet like any other field; dedication and personal interest is the first thing. It is always advisable to visit several universities, review their prospectus and course outlines before making any final decision. Never do it because every one else seem to do it. The best approach would be to visit a career counselor who can advise you better by looking at your grades, your previous academic record and aptitude. All the best!</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms;">&#8220;Hello, I am a fresh engineer graduate, looking for a job these days&#8221;. No, it&#8217;s not what someone said to me, it&#8217;s what I read myself on the face of a person who is a fresh engineering graduate. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms;">The point is; you can easily tell a difference between a normal graduate and an engineering graduate. Whether the graduate has recently joined his first job, or still looking for one, the body language and gestures of all of them are same. </span></span></p>
<p><a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/info.anu.edu.au/studyat/assets/Student_Administration/images/airhats.jpg');" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"  href="http://info.anu.edu.au/studyat/assets/Student_Administration/images/airhats.jpg"><img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 315px; height: 209px;" src="http://info.anu.edu.au/studyat/assets/Student_Administration/images/airhats.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms;">They are confused looking, inadequately dressed up, thick spectacled and have an unnecessarily huge bag on their shoulders just to carry a CV; all appended with a desperate look on face. Being an engineer myself, I don&#8217;t approve of their attire. And this is what exactly creates problem for them in getting a good job, or even getting a promotion at their current job.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms;">If you have just graduated with an engineering degree, and your transcript does not carry an extraordinary GPA (read 4.0 with Gold Medal) or an outstanding institute (foreign probably), then forget that you will get a good job solely on the basis of your degree. Forget everything that has happened in past four years. Leave your degree aside. No employer is interested about semi-conductor diodes or your term paper about 4 G technologies. The first and foremost thing they want from you is you being able to carry that degree you are holding.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms;">To start with, get rid of that desperate look. We know you are an engineer; you lost half your hair studying ponderous books and the rest half in your final year project. We know there is a difference between you and a technician. We know that you know more about modulation techniques or frequency spectrum. But trust me, we don&#8217;t care about it that much. All of this is just twenty percent of what we actually want to see in you. So please stop telling your boss about it time and again or reminding your interviewer about it if he/she asks you if you are able to mount towers to fix a connector at odd working hours or not. If you really need a job, then be positive and flexible.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms;">Number two, look at your self, and assess your attire. No matter how much you despise your hip cousin in his third year of business studies, or the friend who holds a degree from media sciences, if he/she dresses well, adopt it. Keep yourself updated on the trends in good dressing with style. What tie colors are in and what not. It really counts. Don&#8217;t confuse it with being a fashion icon, but your recruiter will really prefer a person with better dressing senses.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms;">Have a life, other than studies. And by life I don&#8217;t mean cricket or video games only. Do you like traveling, music, art, theatre? If not, and you are still one of the lifeless studious geek who can at maximum play cricket outdoors or play counter strike indoor, then you better look deeper. There is a whole world outside your little chamber of studies.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms;">Be more flexible with opposite gender. You are most likely to interact with either gender at all the stages. If you are uncomfortable with the other gender at work, if you look tense or even act too loose as if you haven&#8217;t ever interacted with them before, this can cause a problem. In most corporate organizations, more and more girls are being employed with passing time and both the genders have to work with each other. You discomfort can affect the environment and your performance eventually. You must know the social etiquettes and level of courtesy you must bear when interacting with the fair gender or the level of confidence and self-assurance if you are the gender of minority in the engineering world.</span></span></p>
<p><a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.aus.edu/cas/is/images/graduate_study_after_is2.jpg');" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"  href="http://www.aus.edu/cas/is/images/graduate_study_after_is2.jpg"><img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 279px; height: 307px;" src="http://www.aus.edu/cas/is/images/graduate_study_after_is2.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms;">And last but not the least, be a team player. Learn to sustain ownership. Be confident when you speak and make sure you are not complaining. Nobody likes people who always whine or complains. If your boss is giving you a hard time, and tells you that you need to be flexible with it if you wish to learn and excel, then no matter how much you abhor the whole idea; it is indeed true. Excel yourself in business communication and writing. Even if you feel like you need to have a short course on it, go for it. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms;">This article is not a guide on how to write a CV or prepare for an interview. Simply put, if all of this is reflected nicely in your CV or interview, the chances that you will get a good job as per your desire will increase eighty percent.</span></span></p>
